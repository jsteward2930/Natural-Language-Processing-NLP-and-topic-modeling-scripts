Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.6 or higher
Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)
Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
Replace your-username and your-repository-name with the appropriate values.

Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project directory:

cd your-repository-name
Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can do this using venv:

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
